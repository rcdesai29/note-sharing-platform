# NoteLogger

The objective of our project was to develop a collaborative note-sharing platform meant for UNC Charlotte students, accessible by our school’s “my.charlotte.edu” platform. This software would serve as a digital tool for students to upload, download, and find study materials for classes they already are taking or were interested in. Some key features included feedback, rating, following, and searching courses, ensuring that the most valuable notes could be easily found.
We created our project using the MERN stack. We chose to use the MERN stack for its scalability in creating a dynamic web application such as NoteLogger. Development of our project followed a 13 week timeline, with tasks both centered around accessibility for developers and users alike. We conducted rounds of usability testing each sprint to create internal feedback and refine NoteLogger.
NoteLogger successfully addressed the challenge of finding student-made study resources for classes, which is sure to enhance the learning experiences of struggling UNC Charlotte students. Most of all, NoteLogger’s relevance extends beyond UNC Charlotte, offering potential for the chance at being utilized at other educational institutions.
